FE24 JavaScript 1 - Endproject.

This project is a very simplified version of IMDB, which is a site that has an incredible amount of information about everything movie/tv related. 
We're using https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get an API and use said API in the project to fetch different information about movies, TV-series, as well as actors, directors, etc. 
In my case four different URL's are being fetched.
It contains two buttons that displays the current most popular movies, as well as the highest rated movies. 
Along with this feature, the user can also use a search function, in this case, to search for people and/or titles of movies and TV-series.
